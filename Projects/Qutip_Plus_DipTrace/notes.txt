After you actually drawn your schematic you should divide JJ in groups.
To create a group of JJ, you should select all JJ that you wish to put in this group (via Shift key)
after you rightclick on selection and choose "properties"
then you change name to JosType[i] where i stay for group number (ommit bracket symbols)
Then you go File->Export->NetList->PAD and save file with appropriate name
